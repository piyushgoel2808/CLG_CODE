            The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most
            recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it
            primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but
            social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and
            rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, then become independent and
            leave their mother's home range to establish their own
