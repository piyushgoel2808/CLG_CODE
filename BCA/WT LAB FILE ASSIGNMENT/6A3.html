      <dd>The marquee tag is a non-standard HTML element which causes text to scroll up, down, left or right automatically. The tag was first introduced in early versions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, and was compared to Netscape's blink element, as a proprietary non-standard extension to the HTML standard with usability problems. The W3C advises against its use in HTML documents.</dd>

  <p>EXAMPLE:</p>
   <marquee behavior="scroll" direction="right">THIS IS A EXAMPLE MARQUEE TAG</marquee>

  <marquee><h3>Hyperlink</h3></marquee>
  <dl>
    <dt style="color: blue;">A TAG</dt>
    <dd>The a tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.

        The most important attribute of the a element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
        
        By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
        
        An unvisited link is underlined and blue
        A visited link is underlined and purple
        An active link is underlined and red</dd>
</dl>
<p>EXAMPLE:</p>
  <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="blank">Google</a><br>
  <hr>
  <marquee><h3>IMAGE TAG</h3></marquee>
  <dl>
    <dt style="color: blue;">IMG </dt>
    <dd>The img tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The img tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.</dd>

  <img src="4A FRIENDS FILE/google.png" alt="Google photo" width="20%">
