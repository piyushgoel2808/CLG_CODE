    <p> Institute of Information Technology and Management (IITM) was set up in <em> 1999</em> under the aegis of Mata
        Leelawati
        Shikshan Sansthan (MLSS), a registered education society engaged in philanthropic activities, with the Late Shri
        T.N. Chaturvedi, the well known educationist, parliamentarian, ex-Governor of
        Karnataka and CAG of India and Padma Vibhushan Awardee, as founder President of both the society and the
        Institute.</p>
